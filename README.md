Customer segmentation is a powerful approach to understanding diverse consumer groups and optimizing business strategies. The Turkey Shopping Malls dataset provides a glimpse into consumer behavior across different retail categories and shopping malls in Turkey. With details such as invoice numbers, customer demographics, product categories, payment methods, and purchase dates, this dataset is ideal for exploring shopping trends and customer preferences. 

It offers insights into purchasing patterns, such as how age, gender, and payment methods impact spending habits across various malls like Emaar Square Mall and the Mall of Istanbul. By analyzing this data, businesses can better understand their customers, optimize product offerings, and enhance marketing strategies. 

Effective segmentation helps businesses design personalized marketing campaigns, optimize inventory, and improve customer experiences.
